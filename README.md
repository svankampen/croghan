Welcome to Croghan

This webpage has been created and designed to act as marketing material as part of a *Croghan* webshop going live.
The Croghan webshop is a real project that I am currently working on with a webdesign team however in order to gain supplier buy in we require a clean and concise landing page that allows our perspective suppliers understand what we are all about at *Croghan*

The webpage is targeted towards a curated range of suppliers that create kitchenware with a certain ethos ;

- Enviromentally friendly
- Sustainably sourced
- Giving back to the community
- Quality Gauranteed

## Preparation

- **Wire Frame**
    1. During the planning phase of the project a wireframing tool called balsamiq was used. 
    2. By using a wireframe the webpage could be visualised and the number of sections and functions understood from a highlevel.
    3. Throughout the project the wireframe was used as a guide of what was set out to achieve.
    4. The wireframe file can be viewed here [Link](../croghan/assets/wireframe/Croghan_wire_frame_v1.bmpr)
